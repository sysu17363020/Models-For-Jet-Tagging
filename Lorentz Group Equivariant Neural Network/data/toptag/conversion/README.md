Utilities for converting between file formats.

`raw2h5` : Convert from raw HDF5 files to our HDF5 format.

`hdf2root`: Convert from our HDF5 format to ROOT format.

We will primarily use `raw2h5`, as this gives the format that can be input into the network. The ROOT file format can be used for plotting purposes, although we will primarily use plotting utilities designed for our HDF5 format.
