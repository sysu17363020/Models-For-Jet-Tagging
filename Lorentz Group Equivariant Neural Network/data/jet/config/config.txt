# 1) Process configuration.

	# 1a) Chosen process

	# Give a comma-separated list (spaces allowed). 
	# See the samples subdirectory names to see which 
	# processes are available. The names must match the
	# subdirectory names, and there must be only one
	# template per subdirectory.

	#processes = Top_Wqq, QCD
        processes = Top_Wqq

	# 1b) pT boundaries

	# Give pT values to use as bin edges for 
	# the different samples. Each pT bin will
	# correspond with one condor job.
	# For infinity (valid as an upper bound), add
	# 'inf' to the end of this list.

	# 1c) Number of events
	
	# Give the number of events to generate for
	# each pT window.

	Nevents = 100000

	# 1d) Hadronization

	# Determine whether or not to perform hadronization.
	# 1 = on, 0 = off.

	# 1e) Multi-Parton Interactions

	# Determine whether or not to simulate MPI.
	# 1 = on, 0 = off

	# 1f) Random Seed

	# Seed for the Pythia8 RNG. Use this to generate
	# unique samples for the same configuration.
	# Must be integer greater than 0.

	rng = 1

# 2) Jet clustering

	#2a) Power
	
	# Give a "power" for the generalized kT algo.
	# -1 = anti-kt
	#  0 = Cambrige/Aachen
	#  1 = kt

	#2b) Radius

	# Give the jet radius in eta-phi space.

	#2c) Minimum pT

	# Give the minimum jet pT.

	pT_min = 15.

	#2d) Maxinimum eta

	# Give the maximum (magnitude) of eta.
	# For reference, eta_max = 4.9 corresponds
	# with the maximum possible value for ALTAS,
	# based on the LAr calorimeter geometry.
	
	eta_max = 2.

	#2e) Number of constituents

	# Give the maximum number of jet 
	# constituents to save to our
	# list of constituents. This is the
	# the data that the Lorentz Group Network
	# will actually use. For reference,
	# n_constituents = 200 for the top-tagging
	# reference dataset located at
	# https://zenodo.org/record/2603256 .

        # particles to save for each event.

        n_truth = 3

        #3b) Number of final-state particles

        # Give the maximum number of final-state
        # particles to save for each event.
        # (This probably doesn't need to be changed)
