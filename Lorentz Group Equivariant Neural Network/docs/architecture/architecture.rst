Architecture Overview

Coming Soon....

..
  The LGN architecture is based upon the supplemental material in
  `LGN: Covariant Molecular Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04015>`_.
  
  It is divided into three basic parts:
  
  - :ref:`Input Layers<InputLayers>`
  
  - :ref:`Clesch-Gordan Layers<CGLayers>`
  
  - :ref:`Output Layers<OutputLayers>`
