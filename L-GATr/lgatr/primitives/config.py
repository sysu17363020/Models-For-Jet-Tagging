@dataclass
class LGATrConfig:
    """Configuration for global settings like the symmetry group.

    Parameters
    ----------
    use_fully_connected_subgroup : bool
        If True, model is only equivariant with respect to
        the fully connected subgroup of the Lorentz group,
        the proper orthochronous Lorentz group :math:`SO^+(1,3)`,
        which does not include parity and time reversal.
        This setting affects how the EquiLinear maps work:
        For :math:`SO^+(1,3)`, they include transitions scalars/pseudoscalars
        vectors/axialvectors and among bivectors, effectively
        treating the pseudoscalar/axialvector representations
        like another scalar/vector.
        Defaults to False, because parity-odd representations
        are usually not important in high-energy physics simulations.
    mix_pseudoscalar_into_scalar : bool
        If True, the pseudoscalar part of the multivector mixes
        with the pure-scalar channels in the equiLinear layer.
        This is a technical aspect of how equiLinear maps work,
        and only makes sense it use_fully_connected_subgroup=True.
        Attention: The combination ``use_fully_connected_subgroup=False``
        and ``mix_pseudoscalar_into_scalar=True`` does not make sense,
        you are only equivariant w.r.t. the fully connected subgroup
        if you choose these settings.
    use_bivector : bool
        If False, the bivector components are set to zero after they
        are created in the GeometricBilinear layer.
        This is a toy switch to explore the effect of higher-order
        representations.
    use_geometric_product : bool
        If False, the GeometricBilinear layer is replaced
        by a EquiLinear + ScalarGatedNonlinearity layer.
        This is a toy switch to explore the effect of the geometric product.
